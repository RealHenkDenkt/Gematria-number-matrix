##Inspiration

This application is dedicated to the work of John Elias and many others. 

Please refer to the website http://37x73.com for a mind blowing trip through the 
 astonishing mathematics that drive this reality.  Disclaimer: This application and it's creator are 
 not affiliated in any way or form to mentioned website or work.
 
 With this application I want to contribute a small part in offering a tool to all the researchers that are working,
 often in very different contexts, towards solving the puzzle we call 'life'.
 
 To think this puzzle is even solvable, is absurd, of course.  But let's not forget this world famous artist 
 from my country of birth:
 
 “Only those who attempt the absurd...will achieve the impossible. I think ...I think it's in my basement...Let me go upstairs and check.”
 
 ― M.C. Escher
 
 This application offers one way to 'think out of the box', while looking at numbers in ways that we usually 
 don't look at them.
 
 
 
##Usage:

Use the link below to see the code in action.

https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/RealHenkDenkt/Gematria-number-matrix/blob/main/index.html


##Install:

Clone the repository locally and open the index.html file with a browser.


Notes:
- With large numbers, it can take up to 10-20 seconds for the results to load.
- Some PI and PHI sequences have been added to the type list. The well known 46->19->37 is in there 
and three others, one in PI which has been discovered in 1964 and is 19 long. Two in PHI,
one of length 4 starting at 1000, one of length 19 starting at 66. 



##Simple documentation

###Concepts

This is a tool to analyze/research numbers and their connections through different contexts. 

For example the number 5 in one context, is the multiplication table of 5. In another context, 
it is the third prime number, the first pythagorean prime number and also the 5th Fibonacci number.

These different contexts can be switched using the 'table type' selector in the top center of the 
screen. The first input field 'Factor', is used in two ways. In case 'Multiplication' is selected 
as the matrix type, the multiplication table of the entered number will be shown. If a number type 
(like prime or triangular) is selected, the number that is entered, is where the list of numbers is started.

For example, if 'primes' is selected, and '1' is entered in the first field, the first 50 
prime numbers will be shown.

The two rows of switches at the top of the screen are for two purposes. 

###Showing number types

![alt text](https://github.com/RealHenkDenkt/Gematria-number-matrix/blob/main/img/top-row-toggles-1.png?raw=true)

These buttons represent:

- Prime nunber
- Pythagorean prime number
- Semi prime number
- Triangular number
- Tetrahedral number
- Star number
- Hexagonal number
- Octagonal number
- Fibonacci number
- Lukas number

These buttons can be used to highlight certain number types on the current screen.  

The last button (+++) is a special function which will be explained in the part about the second row of buttons.

The image above shows the prime numbers highlighted in green.

###Selecting irrational numbers

The second row of buttons is used to select irrational numbers to be added to the context. 

The previous image shows three irrational numbers selected: PHI, PHI and Euler. We can observe from the 
image that 2 is the first prime number and that this number is found at the 6th, 19th and 4th positions in the numbers 
of PI, PHI and Euler respectively. The last column shows the sum of these three positions 
added together: 6 + 19 + 4 = 29.

##Number analyzer

The application has a number analyzer implemented as a popup window which is shown below:
 
 ![alt text](https://github.com/RealHenkDenkt/Gematria-number-matrix/blob/main/img/number-analyzer-94.png?raw=true)
 
 This window would popup if we would click the number '94' anywhere on the screen and this will effectively 
 work for most numbers up to one million. Any number that is analyzed, will be presented in it's normal 
 form and it's mirror. In the image above we therefor see the properties of both the number 94 and 
 49. 
 
 From the image we can determine that 94 is the 69th composite or non prime number (the rectangular icon stands for composite 
 or non prime number). We also see that 94 is the 33rd semi prime number. On the other side we can see that 
 49, the mirror of 94, is the 33rd composite or non prime number and it is also the 17th semi prime number. 
 
 The rows below are self explanatory, the squared and cubed values of both number and the summing of the divoros 
 ('full' meaning all divisors of the numbers summed up, the other means the divisors of the number 
 excluding '1' and the number itself).
 
 The row 'summed' means the summing of all the numbers up and including the number itself. For the number '5', 
 the 'summed' row would be: (1+2+3+4+5=) 15.
